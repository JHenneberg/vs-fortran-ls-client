# Fortran IntelliSense
This extension is a Language Server Protocol client that connects 
to [Chris Hansen's Fortran Language Server](https://github.com/hansec/fortran-language-server/) to add IntelliSense for Fortran to Visual Studio 2017.

## Installation
#### Install Fortran Language server
Install Python 2.7. Then install Forran Language Server using pip.
Make sure, however, that you're running pip under Python 2.7 in case you have multiple versions of Python installed.

```
pip install fortran-language-server
```

#### Install the VS extension
Download the VSIX file from releases and install it to your Visual Studio.

Configure the path to Fortran Lanauge Server.

TODO: this is yet to be added, path to server is now hardcoded.
